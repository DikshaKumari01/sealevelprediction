Project: Sea Level Rise Prediction
Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Developed a linear regression model to predict future sea levels based on historical data (1880-2050).
Preprocessed and split the dataset for training and testing, achieving an accurate model using 80% training data.
Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score to assess prediction accuracy.
Visualized sea level rise trends and predicted future sea levels with a regression line.
